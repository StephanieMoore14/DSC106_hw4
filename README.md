Timeline: 
My inspiration from this chart came from wanted to express how not only the number of movies Arnold appeared in grew over time but also how the types of movies he appeared in changed. The sizes of the pie charts in the timeline are proportional to the number of movie he filmed in the corresponding decade. 1980s (14), 1990s (32), 2000s (37), and 2010s (38). I chose to only include the top 3 genres because I wanted to keep in mind Miller's Law (7 +/- 2 will keep my view interested).

Word Cloud:
My inspiration for this visual was finding a way to show which genres were the most popular while adding another dimension to the data. I decided to go with average rating per/ genre. This shows us not only which genres has the most movies made but also how popular the genre was. I broke up the color scale by using the min and max rating as a reference point and making the step betweenn each color even.

Tree Map:
My inspiration for Tree Map came from wanting to use the box office data in some way. I would like to explore the concept of "drilling" more in the final project but I thought the tree map was a cool way to represent the proportions of money from the box office that went to each genre and also how it changed over the decades.

Additional Comments:
I ran into some trouble trying to web scrape the box office information. Turned out that most of the movies did not have information on boxofficemojo.com. Because of this, some of the charts that use that information may not seem entire accurate. I also did not get to customize the tree map as much as I would have like to. For example figuring out how to format the values of the dollar amount into a mroe readable string or adding a picture of the top movie for that decade into the nested part of the map would make it more interesting. Overall, the word cloud was my favorite because I had to think a lot about how to not over-prime my viewers while makeing the information readable.
